        <p>1 - Blend the eggs, cocoa powder, butter, wheat flour, sugar, and milk in a blender for 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>2 - Add the baking powder and gently mix it with a spatula.</p>
        <p>3 - Pour the batter into a greased baking pan and bake in a preheated medium oven (180 ºC / 356 ºF) for about 40 minutes. Make sure to use a tall baking pan for this recipe: since it contains two tablespoons of baking powder, the batter rises significantly</p>
